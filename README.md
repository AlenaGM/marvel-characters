This project was created as a means of learning JSON-format.

The project consists of:

1. JSON data that contains information about Marvel characters.
2. A gallery that showcases pictures, main features, and detailed descriptions of 10 Marvel heroes (obtained from this [article]).

Users can assign a personal rating of 1 to 10 ⭐️ to any character, and these ratings are stored in Local Storage.

A few months after completing the project, I invested time in refactoring the code to enhance its clarity and cleanliness. Moreover, I dedicated significant effort to improving accessibility and performance. I am pleased with the outcome achieved:
