This project was created as a means of learning JSON-format.

The project includes the following elements:

1. JSON data containing information about Marvel characters;
2. A gallery displaying pictures, main features, and detailed descriptions of 10 Marvel heros (content sourced from this [article]);

Users have the ability to assign a personal rating of 1 to 10 ⭐️ to any character. These ratings are stored in Local Storage.

## Updates

A few months following the completion of the project, I invested time in refactoring the code to improve its clarity and cleanliness. Additionally, I dedicated significant effort to improving accessibility and performance. I am pleased with the outcome achieved:
